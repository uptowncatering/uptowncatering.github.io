				<p class="testimonial">"For our daughter’s recent wedding, you provided flowers and catered the reception and we wanted to say how pleased we were with everything that you did.  The flowers perfectly complemented the church and reception hall and most importantly our daughter and her bridesmaids.  The food was exquisite both in its presentation and taste.  Everyone enjoyed it!  You and your staff were a complete delight to work with.  Indeed, we are so pleased that we have given your name to others planning such events.  Thank you for what you did to add to a very special day!"</p>
